## F1 Data Analysis

Formula 1 (F1) is a high-octane sport that blends cutting-edge technology, strategy, and raw speed. Each race weekend offers a dynamic and complex interplay of factors that can influence the outcome, from weather conditions and track characteristics to driver performance and team strategies. Understanding these variables can provide valuable insights into the nuances of the sport, making data analysis a crucial tool for teams, fans, and analysts alike.

As a passionate F1 enthusiast, I dive into a thorough analysis of F1 race data in this project, concentrating on a range of performance metrics and environmental factors. My goal is to examine how elements like track temperature, air pressure, humidity, and wind speed impact car performance and race results. By utilizing detailed telemetry data, weather conditions, and other race-related variables, I aim to uncover patterns and trends that provide a deeper insight into the factors driving success on the track.

Through this project, I hope to contribute to the broader discussion on F1 performance analytics and offer a valuable resource for enthusiasts and professionals seeking to enhance their understanding of the sport using my background in data and financial analytics.
