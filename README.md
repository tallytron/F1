## F1 Data Analysis

Formula 1 (F1) is a high-octane sport that blends cutting-edge technology, strategy, and raw speed. Each race weekend offers a dynamic and complex interplay of factors that can influence the outcome, from weather conditions and track characteristics to driver performance and team strategies. Understanding these variables can provide valuable insights into the nuances of the sport, making data analysis a crucial tool for teams, fans, and analysts alike.

In this project, I delve into a comprehensive analysis of F1 race data, focusing on various performance metrics and environmental factors. Our aim is to explore how different elements such as track temperature, air pressure, humidity, and wind speed affect car performance and race outcomes. By leveraging detailed telemetry data, weather conditions, and other race-related variables, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that can offer a deeper understanding of what drives success on the track.

Through this project, I hope to contribute to the broader discussion on F1 performance analytics and offer a valuable resource for enthusiasts and professionals seeking to enhance their understanding of the sport using my background in data and financial analytics.
